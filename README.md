👋 Hello! I'm Kenny, a full-stack software engineer with a background in mathematics and philosophy. I'm familiar with both Javascript and Python stacks.\
🔭 My most recent professional experience was working primarily in Python/Django, but alas the codebase is private so you will not be able to see that in my repos.\
⚙️ I’m currently doing some freelancing and working on a decentralized library application.\
🌱 Right now I'm learning TypeScript, Tailwind, and Next.js.\
🤝 I'm looking to collaborate on open source projects, and open to working either remote or in person.\
📫 Feel free to reach me: kenny.burgher@gmail.com.
